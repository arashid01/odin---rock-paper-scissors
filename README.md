# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game I built using HTML and JavaScript. It's part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I’m practicing DOM manipulation, functions, and event handling.

The game plays in the browser — first to 5 points wins!

## How It Works

- You pick **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking a button.
- The computer randomly chooses its move.
- The result of each round is shown on the screen.
- Once either the human or computer reaches 5 points, the game ends and a message appears to let you know if you won or lost.
- You can keep playing after that — the game resets the scores automatically when you make your next move.

## What I Learned

- How to use `querySelector` and dynamically create elements with JavaScript.
- How to handle user input with `addEventListener`.
- Writing game logic using `if` statements and comparisons.
- Managing scores and resetting state after each match.
- Handling line breaks properly in HTML using either `<br>` or DOM methods instead of `\n`.

## Tech Used

- **HTML** for the structure  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for all the game logic  
- No external libraries or CSS for now — keeping it simple and focused on functionality

## Why I Made This

This was a fun mini project to apply what I’ve been learning about JavaScript and DOM interactions. It helped me get more comfortable with event listeners, conditional logic, and creating elements dynamically in the browser.
